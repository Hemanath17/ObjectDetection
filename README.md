# ObjectDetection
YOLO - You Only Look Once Algorithm with the use of coco.names dataset will enable the Machine to train in order to detect the video or images using single glance at the input video or image. 

With the use of yolo datasets obtained from the darknett the machine performs a task to split the image into 19 x 19 matrix sqaure images which later draws a bounding box to predict the object or a person.

The main default prediction will be those datasets which are inbuilt in the coco.names files.
